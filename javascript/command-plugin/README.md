# Command Plugin

Commands allow you to greatly expand your api by allowing you to dynamically return
data from your api. Commands are defined in the `commands` directory and are
automatically loaded by the plugin.

Then the chatbot can see the command list, and run the commands for you even though
they aren't defined in your openapi spec.

## Usage

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```
