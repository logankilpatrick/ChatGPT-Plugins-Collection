# TodoGPT (JavaScript)

## Overview

TodoGPT is a plugin for ChatGPT that allows users to manage their to-do items. With this plugin, users can create, update, delete, and view their to-do items.

## Setup and Run

1. Navigate to the root directory of the TodoGPT (JavaScript) plugin.

2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.

3. Start the server by running `node server.js`.

The application will be accessible at the specified address and port.

## How It Works

The TodoGPT plugin provides endpoints to manage to-do items. The main code for the application is in the `server.js` file. Here are some of the available endpoints:

- `GET /todos`: Retrieve a list of all to-do items.
- `POST /todos`: Create a new to-do item.
- `PUT /todos/:id`: Update an existing to-do item by ID.
- `DELETE /todos/:id`: Delete an existing to-do item by ID.

When a user interacts with these endpoints, the application performs the corresponding actions on the to-do items.

## Setting Up the Plugin with ChatGPT

To set up the TodoGPT (JavaScript) plugin as a ChatGPT plugin, follow the instructions provided in the "Develop your own plugin" section of the ChatGPT API documentation. Input the URL of the TodoGPT plugin to set it up as a plugin.

Once the plugin is set up, you can interact with it through ChatGPT. For example, you can send messages to create, update, delete, and view to-do items, and ChatGPT will interact with the TodoGPT plugin to perform the requested actions.
